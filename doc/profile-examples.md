# Examples of Profile Settings

HID controller inputs can be mapped to joystick port pins using profiles. Multiple profiles may be defined and assigned to specific controllers, uniquely identified by their MAC addresses. When a controller is connected, Blue2Joy automatically selects the correct profile.

**Digital and Analog Inputs**

The joystick port provides five digital and two analog inputs. Each input can be mapped to either a button or an analog stick. Button inputs support inversion. Analog stick inputs support configurable threshold, hysteresis, and optional inversion.

**Integrators and encoders**

Each profile can define two virtual integrators or quadrature encoders for processing relative inputs, such as mouse movement on the X and Y axes or integrated gamepad stick deflection.

Integrator positions can be mapped to analog pins, while quadrature encoder outputs can be mapped to digital pins.
